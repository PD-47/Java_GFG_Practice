# 🌀 While Loop – Print Table in Reverse (Java)

## 🧠 Problem Description
While loop is another loop like for loop but unlike for loop it only checks for one condition. 
Here, we will use a while loop and print a number n's table in reverse order.

## Examples:

Input: n = 1

Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Input: n = 2

Output: 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2

Constraints:
1 <= n<= 1000
